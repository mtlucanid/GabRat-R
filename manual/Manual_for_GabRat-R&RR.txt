1. Download the Natsumushi app
 - Latest version will be available in the author's website:
   https://sites.google.com/site/mtahashilucanid/program/natsumushi
 - To install the app, create any file folder and extract the zip 
   file into the directory. Natshumushi app does not use the windows
   registory. All the app settings are saved in "Natsumushi.ini" file
   when exiting the app, and loaded when restarting the app. To inhibit
   the unexpected changes of app settings, set the ini file as read-only
   after you apply proper customization. To clear all the custom settings
   and restore their default, delete the ini file or rename it.   
 
2. App settings before use
 - To clear all settings, delete an exsisting "Natsumushi.ini" file
   (recommended). 
 - Open Natsumushi 2.0 software on Windows.
 - Go to [View] -> [Window Layout] and select one of the 'Extra windows' 
   views (10 or 11 are recommended). The app will be restarted.   
 - Click the [Settings] toolbar button (the gear icon) to show the setting 
   window. It is located left of the main window and have green background 
   when the setting mode is active. Scroll the view and find the environment 
   variables for GabRat settings (most of their names begin with "gabrat." 
   but a few display options are grouped in "silent."). Modify them as 
   required and close the app (it saves all the setting changes to 
   "Natsumushi.ini" file). Set the ini file as read-only, if you want to 
   avoid unexpected changes to the settings. Belows are typical GabRat 
   settings for different analyses.

   Fixed settings (recommended):
    gabrat.baseangle = 0.000000
    gabrat.fx = 2.000000
    gabrat.gamma = 1.000000
    gabrat.nangles = 4
  
  For Original GabRat:
    gabrat.random_nindividual = 0
    gabrat.random_nrepeat = 0
    gabrat.random_rndbaseangle = false

  For GabRat-R:
    gabrat.random_nindividual = 1
    gabrat.random_nrepeat = 1000 (*typically)
    gabrat.random_rndbaseangle = true
  
  For GabRat-RR:
    gabrat.random_nindividual = 1000 (*typically)
    gabrat.random_nrepeat = 1
    gabrat.random_rndbaseangle = true
    gabrat.random_usebgmask = 0 (*use entire range of the background)
      or,
    gabrat.random_usebgmask = 1 (*use specified range of the background)

3. Calculation
   
3a. Original GabRat
  - Open the image in the Natsumushi 2.0 main window. The image may be
    an object placed on some background. 
  - Set a ROI on the image or load a shape file and apply the shape
    as ROI. See Natsumushi's manual for the setting of ROI in multiple 
    ways.
  - Push [RabRat] toolbar button.
  
3b. GabRat-R
  - Open the image in the Natsumushi 2.0 main window. The image 
    may be an object placed on some background. 
  - Set a ROI on the image or load a shape file and apply the shape
    as ROI. See Natsumushi's manual for the setting of ROI in multiple 
    ways.
  - Push [RabRat-R] toolbar button.
  
3b. GabRat-RR
  - Open the image in the Natsumushi 2.0 main window. The image 
    may be an object placed on some background or one without 
	background. 
  - Open the background image in the sub window. To do this, drag
    the image and drop it into one of the sub windows (right ones),
    or drop it with pressing [Ctrl] key.
  - When using [gabrat.random_usebgmask] option, confirm that a mask
    file (e.g. "foo01.msk") is present in the same folder where the 
	background image (e.g. "foo01.jpg") exists.	
  - Set a ROI on the main image or load a shape file and apply the shape
    as ROI. See Natsumushi's manual for the setting of ROI in multiple 
    ways.
  - Push [RabRat-R] toolbar button.
